# LogoImageGenerator
A python script to transform images into pictures for Logo (MSX Computer)

- The Donatello script emulates key presses using PyAutoGUI to send to an Emulator (MSX) and build the picture.
- DonatelloFAST gives you a file which can be mounted as a disk to use the recordar command to load the picture.

This was programmed for the spanish ROM of LOGO (Talent MSX). To work with other roms, you could rename the commands inside the script to the ones in other roms.
